# Bank Customer Churn Prediction Analysis

## Introduction
This project, is a comprehensive analysis of a dataset derived from a deep learning model trained on the Bank Customer Churn Prediction dataset. 

The primary aim is to compare the performance of different data imputation techniques, evaluating their impact on model performance and the deviation from original values. 
This analysis is vital for understanding the nuances of handling missing data and optimizing machine learning pipelines for real-world banking datasets.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Bank Customer Churn Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e1/data).

## Problem Definition
The focus of this project is on the binary target variable 'Exited', which indicates whether a bank customer has churned. The goal is to build predictive models to assess the likelihood of customer churn and evaluate how different imputation strategies affect the performance of these models.

## Implementation
The Jupyter notebook contains several sections, starting with data preprocessing, where various imputation techniques are applied. The notebook progresses through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building, culminating in a comparative analysis of the results.

### Technologies Used
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation
- Various imputation methods including MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to install the required Python libraries listed in the notebook. Clone this repository, install dependencies, and run the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
